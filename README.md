# bioinformatics_stronghold
- This repository presents my developing knowledge of Bioinformatics algorithms and understanding. 
- These are answers to problems sourced from Rosalind.info, a website that provides practise problem 
sets for learning Bioinformatics via problem solving. 
- I complete and upload algorithms to this repository once I have gained a particular 
level of confidence in undersatnding how they work. You can also visit my Medium Page,
where I have posted essay walkthroughs displaying my understading of some of the algorithms I
have learned/completed. Medium: https://medium.com/@danielpintard
